      <div className='about'>
        <p>I am originally from Washington State, but I lived in Phnom Penh, Cambodia for 6 years as an English teacher.</p>
        <p>Traveling is one of my favorite hobbies and my goal is to visit at least 100 countries before I'm 40.</p>
        <p>I love lifting weights and going to different gyms around the world.</p>
        <p>Cooking is something I truly enjoy. It relaxes me and helps me feel in control of my life when it feels like we are moving around too fast.</p>
        <p>I am a self-taught JavaScript developer.</p>
